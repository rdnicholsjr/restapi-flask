# restapi-flask

This is a first project so I'll probably babble a bit in this while trying not to write an entire manifesto..

This project is to build and solidify my understanding of building a python/flask RestAPI server and a JS/HTML client to access it.  Nothing fancy, just basic CRUD operations and basic http authentication for now.  This may change as time goes on.
